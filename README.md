# BCcolocalisation_AJHG_2020
Scripts used for BCAC/GTEx colocalisation analysis 


#### Background 
The causal variants and genes underlying breast cancer risk associations are largely unknown. We used genetic colocalisation analysis to identify loci at which gene expression could potentially explain breast cancer phenotypes. Using data from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium and quantitative trait loci (QTL) data from the GTEx Project version 8, our findings reveal novel genetic associations between cancer phenotypes and effector genes. These results provide a source of loci for gene validation experiments.
Abundant gene expression associations mean that demonstration of genetic colocalisation is required to mitigate false positive or co-incident interpretation. We used hyprcoloc to identify co-localisation between breast cancer risk and gene expression in normal human breast tissue from 396 samples from GTEx v8.
